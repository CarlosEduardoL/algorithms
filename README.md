# 40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know

This repository contains implementations of the algorithms described in the book "40 Algorithms Every Programmer Should Know", in various programming languages.

## Algorithms

### Sort Algorithms

- [x] Bubble sort

- [ ] Merge Sort

- [ ] Insertion Sort

- [ ] SHell Sort

- [ ] Selection Sort

## Languages

Currently, the following programming languages are supported:

- Rust
- Python
- Nim
- Go

## Getting Started

To use these algorithms in your project, you can copy the implementation of the algorithm you need from the source files in the corresponding language directory. Each implementation is self-contained and should work out of the box, provided you have the necessary dependencies installed.

Alternatively, you can build the project for the language of your choice and use the resulting library file or executable in your project.
